### Editing Content

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file thanks to Next.js hot reload feature.

### Adding Pages

Create new pages by adding files in the `app` directory following Next.js App Router conventions.

### Styling

The project uses Next.js built-in CSS support. You can:
- Add global styles in `app/globals.css`
- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Integrate Tailwind CSS or other styling solutions

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy on Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
4. Your site will be deployed with a production URL
